Major updates:
Version 3.0
1. update scikit-learn model to the latest version
2. use pandas dataframe to process all candidates instead of write out to disk
3. parallel processing with swifter
4. fix bugs for module 1 and 2
 
Version 2.5
1. Resolve cat: Argument too long issue
2. Remove intermdediate files
3. Skip for the lack of TIR predicitons

Versions 1.21 and 1.22
1. Replace blastdbcmd with call_seq_by_list.pl for much stable and faster performance
2. If blastdbcmd has to be used, blast+ 2.5.0 - 2.6.0 works.

Versions 1.19 and 1.20
1. Reuse filtered GRF results in the /temp folder for reanalyses
2. Filter out input sequence that is shorter than $l+500 bp
3. Tolerate sequence that has no TIRs found in it

Version 1.18
1. Add a checking step for Module 1. Exit when no homology is found between input and database.
2. Update installation and usage instructions.

Versions 1.16 and 1.17
1. Add a keras-trained model to classify TIRs for non-rice and non-maize species (Module3_New)
2. Add TIRvish as a potential TIR search engine.

Version 1.15
1. Improved parameter reading from command line
2. Suppress warning messages
3. Clean up and formatting codes

Version 1.14
1. Add parameter -l (max length), user defined maximium length of TIR elements.
2. Add parameter -s (species) , user defined "Maize", "Rice" or "others"; Maize RefLib and Maize model are saved in this package.
3. Use multiprocessing to extract the sequence from the genome sequence (faster than 1.13)
4. Module3_New is tested by using maize chromosome 10.  No error is reported.
